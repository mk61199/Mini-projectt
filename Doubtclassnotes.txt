3. S3 ---> Completed with Lab
4. AMI Permissions
5. AWS Lab Access  --> Complete
6. LeaderShip Principle

t,x,c,m,m2  --> Family Type

2 --> generation

.micro --> what is the size of the instance

Instance Purchasing Options
1. On Demand :- Right Now Right Away  (Most Costly Way to get an Instance)
2. Reserved :- When resource has been allocated to us for specified duration continously
					1. AURI  -> All Upfront Reservered Instance (Maximum Discount)
					2. PURI ->  Partial Upfront Reservered Instance ( a little lower than AURI Discount)
					3. NURI -> No Upfront Reserved Instance (Little or no discount)
3. capacity Reservation
		When not certain if needed or not in future --> Discounts === PURI
4. Spot Instance
	Bidding --> Whoever Bids Highest will get the ionstance for 4 hours only

Linux File System

/  -> It is Top of the hierarchy in Linux (Root)
1. /bin -> All the binary executables of linux is present in this directory
2. /sbin -> All the BVinary which are of admin privileges 
3. /boot -> All the files related to starting of your system (GRUB)
4. /dev -> Has the List of all the peripheral H/W
5. /etc -> All the configuration Files in your system is located in etc 
6. /home -> All The users Home Directory will be here ( by default )  -> Normal Users
7. /root -> The Home Directory of administrator of Linux 
8. /lib -> All the Library Files of Linux of 32 bit architecture are located here
9. /lib64 ->All the Library Files of Linux of 64 bit architecture are located here
10. /media -> All the Media Files can be found here 
11. /mnt -> General location where every user (by default) mounts their Storage Device is mnt .
12. /opt -> CDs OCR MICR devices mounted in this location  (by default)
13. /proc -> Volatile Memory Location data is cleared when system is shut down 
14. /run -> Runnable Media are shown here 
15. /srv -> Services data / service cache file will be stored here
16. /sys -> System Data / System Cache files will be stored here
17. /tmp -> Tenporary File Folder similar to temp in windows 
18. /usr -> All the 3rd party softwares , documentation and other things are stored under usr

User and Group Administration

5 Types of users
1. Admin User  --> has all the privileges on the system, he can do anything on the system
2. Power User  --> has all the pivileges on the system , he can do anything on the system but cannot delete admin user
3. system user --> So a process started by no-one still it is running on the system it is ran by system users/daemon users
4. Normal user --> General Users play games,watch movie,netflix 
5. Guest user --> Temporary access to someone then we create guest user.


Important Files / Directories 

/etc/passwd :- Contains all the information about a user--> UID,GID,username,gecos,homedirectorylocation,shell
/etc/shadow :- Contains Users Password and the age of expiry of the password and any password policy
/etc/group  :- Contains all the information about a group --> Groupname,GID,members of the group, Linktopasswordfile
/etc/gshadow :- All the group passwords are inside this file 

/etc/skel :- This is a directory :- .bashrc , .bash_profile , .bash_logout
			.bashrc --> Used when we want to create a alias of our command 
			.bash_profile --> When users logs in this file is executed by default 
			.bash_logout --> When user will logout from the system this file will be executed 


Content of /etc/passwd
ec2-user     :x        :1000           :1000            :Cloud User            :/home/ec2-user               :/bin/bash

Username    Link        UID              GID              gecos     				Home Directory						Shell                          
				to																						Location						By Which User logs in
				shadow
				file
				which 
				contains
				password
				of the
				user


Username --> Unique name for identifying any user

Link to shadow file --> Generating a Link b/w /etc/passwd  and /etc/shadow  & This is a password field

UID  ---> User ID --> contains what type of user i am and also what actions can i perform 

UID==0  --> User is root (admin user)
UID == 1-999 --> User is system user
UID == 1000-60000 --> User is Normal user

GID  ---> Group ID --> contains what group the user belongs and the primary group 

GID==0  --> Group is root (admin user)
GID == 1-999 --> Group is system user
GID == 1000-60000 --> Group is Normal user

gecos --> Personal Information about a user 

Home Directory location --> Where the user's home directory is located 

Shell By Which users logs in --> Which Shell to use when user logs in 


** NOTE :- Whenever you create a user you make entries in 

/etc/passwd
/etc/shadow
/etc/group
/etc/gshadow

/etc/skel --> User's Home Directory

Permissions 

Allowing Someone to do Something 

read(r) ==> To View the content of files/directory
write(w) ==> To create,modify(edit) a file/directory
execute(x) ==> Run a program/directory (cd)

File permissions 

**NOTE:- By default no file is given executable permissions by default we always have to give it manually.

There are 2 methods to set permissions or calculate permissions


-   rw-rw-r--   . 1 oslo   prasiddh  0 Sep 22 14:40 test.txt

 rw-              rw-                  r--

Owner				Group						Other Users


1. Numerical method (Octal Method)


r=4
w=2
x=1


rwx = 4+2+1==7

rwx    r-x       r-x

rwx = 4+2+1 = 7
r-x = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5
r-x = 4+0+1 = 5

rwxr-xr-x == 755 ==> Octal value of the permission you wanted.

-wxr-xrwx == 357

rw-rw-rw- == 666

r-------- == 400
--------x == 001
------rwx == 007

chmod <OctalValue> <File/Directory>

Full Permission of File ==> rw-rw-rw- == 666 - 022 = 644 ==> rw-r--r--

2. Alphabetical Method/Symbolic Method / ugo method

u= whatever permission you want to give to a owner
g= whatever permission you want to give to a group
o= whatever permission you want to give to a other user

chmod u=rw- <file/Directory>





Directory Permissions 

Full Permission == rwxrwxrwx == 777 - 022 ==> 755 ==>rwxr-xr-x


Copy File :- cp  -v <Source Path>  <Destination Path>
Copy a Directory :- cp -rv <Source Path>  <Destination Path>
To move a directory/file :- mv -v  <Source>  <Destination>
