.bashrc -> This file is used to create shortcuts of command 
.bash_profile -> Is the File called when we log in to the system

Whenever you generate a user /etc/skel directory data will get copy pasted inside the new user home directory



mitali:  x    :0    :1001   :       :/home/mitali     :/bin/bash



mitali -> Username 
x -> password link
UID -> User Identification Number 


0  = Root (Administrator)
1-999 = System Users (Daemons)
1000-60000 = Normal Users 

Mitali is a normal User => Power User => Change UID Value to 0



GID -> Group Identification Number 
The Group ID ==> 0 ==> Power User 



---------------------------------------------------



aruljothi       :x         :0        :0      :         :/home/aruljothi     :/bin/bash


1. aruljothi ?? -> username 
2. x  ---> it has a link to the password file (/etc/shadow)
3. 1003  --> UID

UID (USer Identification)

0 = root 
1-999 = System Users/ Daemons
1000-60000 = Normal Users





4. 1003 --> GID (Group Id)

0= Root
1-999 = System Users/Daemons
1000-60000 = Normal groups

32bit --> 
In programming there are data types 
integer type of data --> int data type 

32 bit complier --> int --> 2 bytes 
64 bit complier --> int ---> 4 bytes 
----------------------------------------------------------
Editing Of files 


1. vi Editor 

insert mode --> Inserting of Data opening in writing mode (i)
Escape Mode --> Coming out of a command is escape mode (Esc)
Command Mode --> Actions or commands for vi editor is done here .. How to activate the command mode --> :

** NOTE :- For command mode you must be in escape mode 


A few commands :-

1. i --> insert mode 
2. o --> open a new line just below the line /cursor
3. O --> Open a new line just below the line/ cursor
4. dd --> Deleting a line 
5. yy --> Copying the line 
6. yw --> Copy a word
7. p --> Pasting 
8. gg --> Go to Top of the Page 
9. G --> Go to bottom of the page 
9. :q --> Quitting

Permissions

Is a authorization level granted to each user/group

Authentication vs Authorization ?

What Do we know ? What do we have ?

3 Types of Permissions 

1. read(r) :-  Reading of the content of the file / directory
2. write(w) :- Writing means to create or to edit the file  / directory
3. execute(x) :- Running of a file / Directory


-       rw-r--r--    .



-rw-r--r--. 1 root root  255 Sep 19 06:37 a.txt




rw-    r--       r--

rwx


1. Owner 
2. Group (Family Group)
3. Other Users 

2 Methods to calculate permissions

1. Numerical


r=4
w=2
x=1


4+2+1=7 ==> Full Permission

rw-  rwx   r-x = 675

4+2+0=6

4+2+1=7

4+0+1=5

-wx  r-x  rwx = 357 ==> 0+2+1=3   4+0+1=5   4+2+1=7

rwxrwxrwx ==> 777

r-- --- --- ==> 400

rw- --- --- ==> 600 

------r-- ==> 004

chmod <permissionvalue>  File/Directory  --> Syntax

Permissions 

Authentication vs Authorization ?

Authentication --> But verifying who you are? by tokens 
Authorization --> What access level do the user has of the system / infrastructure .

What do you know ? What Do you have ?

3 types of permissions 

1. read(r) --> To view the content of the file/directory
2. write(w) --> To Create,modify(edit) a file / directory
3. execute(x)  --> To run a program/file/Directory



-  rw-r--r--    .




-rw-r--r--. 1 root root  120 Sep 19 10:51 a.txt


rw-r--r--

2 methods ->
1. Numerical Method (Octal Method)

r =4
w=2
x=1

rwx
=> 4 + 2 + 1 = 7




rw-                 r--                        r--

Owner              Group Permission          Other Users Permmision


rw- = 4+2+0 = 6
r-- = 4+0+0 = 4
r-- = 4+0+0=  4

rw-r--r-- = 644


r-x    -wx    rw-    =>

r-x=4+0+1=5
-wx = 0+2+1=3
rw- = 4+2+0 = 6

r-x-wxrw- = 536


r-x------ = 500 G=no Permission O=Read & Excute Other=No Permissions
rwxrwxrwx = 777 G=Full Permission,O=Full Permission,Other=Full Permission
rw---x--x = 611 G= Execute , O= Rad Write , Other = Execute
r-xr-x--x = 551 => G= Readand Execute , O = Read & execute , Other= Execute
r-------- = 400  => G= No permissions , O = read Permission, Other = No Permission
-w------- = 200 => G= No Permissions , O= Write Permission, Other = No Permission

=> What is the permission of the group?
=> What is the permission of the owner?
=> What is the permission of the other user?


r-x rw-  r-x
r-x = 4 + 0 + 1 = 

r-x  ---  --- 


chmod <Numeric value of permission> <file/directory>
