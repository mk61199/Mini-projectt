Open System Interconnection(OSI) Model

**NOTE:- It is a refernece model not a implemented model

There are  7 Layers in OSI Model 

1. Application Layer ---> 7th Layer of OSI
2. Presentation Layer---> 6th Layer of OSI
3. Session Layer	 ---> 5th Layer of OSI
4. Transport Layer  ---> 4th Layer of OSI
5. Network Layer    ---> 3rd Layer of OSI
6. Data Link Layer  ---> 2nd Layer of OSI
7. Physical Layer   ---> 1st layer of OSI


Im sender of the data

Sender to Reciever 
 
1. Application Layer :- This Layer has the ability to request for interactive user. It prepares data to be 
							sent over the network.
							Eg:- HTTPS,HTTP,FTP

							In what form is your data in this layer?
							data is in the form of data only

2. Presentation Layer :- This Layer present your data so that processing can be done. It is responsible for
								encoding/decoding your data before it is sent on the network. It is also used for
								compresssing and decompressing the data over the network.
							EG:- HTTPS,FTPS,HTTP,FTP,SMTP
					In what form is your data in this layer?
							data is in the form of data only

3. Session Layer :- A connection for the period to perform a particular task/process over the network this layer
							is utilized.
						Eg:- Downloading the File , To maintain connection from server 

					In what form is your data in this layer?
							data is in the form of data only

4. Transport Layer:- End to end communication b/w applications is done by transport layer. It defines which protocol to use
							and here the port number is also added to the data 
							EG:- End to end encryption by whatsapp.
							80 --> HTTP
							22 --> SSH
							3389 --> RDP
					There are 2 protocols --> TCP , UDP , QUIC

					n what form is your data in this layer?
							data is in the form of segments only

5. Network Layer:- To add the information to the data on which system it has to go/which system is the data coming from
						because it adds/reads the IP address (Logical Address). ALL the routing switching happens in this layer

							in what form is your data in this layer?
							data is in the form of packets only

6. Data Link Layer :-  There are 2 jobs of data link layer 
							1. To add MAC (Media Access Control) address (Physical Address of the network interface cards)
							2. TO check data Intergrity via checksum

						MAC address --> 48bit address which is in the form of hexadecimal 

						NUmber 0-9, 10 --> A , 11 --> B , 12 --> C 13 -->D 14 --> E 15 --> F

					Decimal <-> Binary
					Decimal <-> Hexadecimal

					c2f7c643a9e4c23a4f0c45763243f598

					in what form is your data in this layer?
							data is in the form of frames only

7. Physical Layer :- All the hardware,cables are used now to send your data on the networking cables to the recievers.

					in what form is your data in this layer?
							data is in the form of bits only
